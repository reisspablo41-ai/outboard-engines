            <p>Winterizing your outboard is crucial to extending its life and ensuring it starts up on the first crank next spring. Here is a comprehensive guide to getting your 4-stroke ready for the cold.</p>
            <h3>1. Flush the Engine</h3>
            <p>Run the engine with fresh water using muffs or a flush port for at least 15 minutes to remove salt and sediment.</p>
            <h3>2. Stabilize the Fuel</h3>
            <p>Add a high-quality fuel stabilizer to your tank and run the engine for 10 minutes to ensure treated fuel reaches the injectors.</p>
            <h3>3. Change the Oil</h3>
            <p>Old oil can become acidic and damage internal components. Change the engine oil and filter before storage.</p>
            <h3>4. Fog the Cylinders</h3>
            <p>Remove spark plugs and spray fogging oil into each cylinder to prevent corrosion on the cylinder walls.</p>

        title: "Prop Pitch Explained: Speed vs. Hole Shot",
        excerpt: "Understanding the physics of your propeller. Are you running the right pitch for your boat's weight?",
        content: `
            <p>Propeller pitch is the distance a prop would move forward in one revolution if moving through a soft solid, like a screw through wood.</p>
            <h3>Lower Pitch (e.g., 17")</h3>
            <p>Like low gear in a car. Provides better "hole shot" (acceleration) and pushing power, but lower top speed. Ideal for heavy loads or watersports.</p>
            <h3>Higher Pitch (e.g., 21")</h3>
            <p>Like high gear in a car. Provides higher top speed but slower acceleration. Ideal for light boats looking for maximum velocity.</p>
            <h3>Finding the Sweet Spot</h3>
            <p>Your goal is to select a pitch that allows your engine to reach the top of its recommended RPM range at WOT (Wide Open Throttle).</p>

        title: "Troubleshooting: Why Won't My Outboard Start?",
        excerpt: "The 5 most common reasons for a no-start condition and how to fix them on the water.",
        content: `
            <p>Turn the key and nothing happens? Or it cranks but won't fire? Here are the most common culprits:</p>
            <h3>1. Kill Switch Lanyard</h3>
            <p>It sounds silly, but check that the safety lanyard is properly attached. It's the #1 reason for a no-spark condition.</p>
            <h3>2. Neutral Safety Switch</h3>
            <p>Move the throttle shifter back and forth to ensure it's firmly in neutral. The engine won't crank if it thinks it's in gear.</p>
            <h3>3. Battery Connections</h3>
            <p>Check for loose or corroded wing nuts on your starting battery. Even a slightly loose connection can prevent cranking.</p>
            <h3>4. Fuel Bulb Primer</h3>
            <p>Is the primer bulb hard? If not, give it a few squeezes until it gets firm to ensure fuel is at the engine.</p>
