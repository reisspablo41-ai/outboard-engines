This project is the development of a comprehensive marine commerce platform that functions as both a High-Value Dealership and a Technical Parts Retailer.

The platform is designed to bridge the gap between two distinct customer journeys:

The Lifestyle Purchase: A premium showroom experience for customers buying complete Boats and Outboard Motors. This side of the business focuses on high-resolution visuals, detailed performance specifications, and lead generation for high-ticket sales.

The Technical Utility: A high-precision e-commerce engine for Marine Parts and Propellers. This side focuses on utility, "Part Number" search accuracy, and fitment data to help boat owners and mechanics find specific mechanical components for engine repair and maintenance.

By consolidating these two models, the site aims to become a single-source authority for boat ownership—supporting the customer from the initial purchase of the vessel to the long-term maintenance of its internal engine components.
